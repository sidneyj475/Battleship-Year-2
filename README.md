# Battleship-Year-2
The second iteration of the battleship project. This time visualizing the game using a breadboard connected to a Raspberry Pi using a T-cobbler and tri-color LEDs. The LEDs light up red when missed, green when hit, and orange once the entire ship has been sunk. A has also been programmed to sound when a ship has been hit or sunk.
